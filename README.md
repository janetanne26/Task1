###Prerequisites
1. Create a Task-1 folder in your repository and check-in/push all these tasks in github
account
2. Under that Task-1 folder, add a text file task-1-readme.txt. This readme should contain all
the below 15 questions for future reference. (Copy & Paste)
3. Avoid hard coding as far as possible & obtain the needed inputs from command line
4. Array length & Array values should be obtained from command line
5. Each program should contain separate .java files & should not have a main method.
6. You should have only one Task1Runner.java(main class) which should handle the inputs
for all the below 15 pgms and invoke the individual classes & their methods for each task.
7. Give meaningful class names, method names & variable names. Avoid one or two letter
variable names.
8. Please think through the logic(s) on your own.Referring to the internet for logic will result
in crap code. So please refrain from that as much as possible.
9. Refer javadocs to know the inbuilt methods of Arrays & come up with fresh logics.
1. Write a Java program to find the index of an array element. (numeric array)
2. Write a Java program to sum values of a numeric array.
3. Write a Java program to remove a specific element from an array.
4. Write a Java program to insert an element (specific position) into an array.
5. Write a Java program to test if an array contains a specific value.
6. Write a Java program to find the maximum and minimum value of a numeric array.
7. i.Write a Java program to find the common elements between two arrays (string values).
ii.Write a Java program to find the common elements between two arrays of integers.
8. Write a Java program to remove duplicate elements from an array.
9. Write a Java program to find the number of even and odd integers in a given array of integers.
10. Write a Java program to compute the average value of an array of integers except the largest
and smallest values.
11. Write a Java program to find the sum of the two elements of a given array which is equal to a
given integer.
Sample array: [1,2,4,5,6] , Target value: 6.
12. Write a Java program to reverse an array of integer values.
13. Write a Java program to separate even and odd numbers of an array of integers. Put all even
numbers first, and then odd numbers
14. Write a Java program to sort a numeric array
15. Write a Java program to print all the LEADERS in the array.
Note: An element is leader if it is greater than all the elements to its right side.
